## Project #1 :- Handle Error Rows in Data Factory Mapping Data Flows
In this project i have built an pipeline in Azure Data Factory which is going to extract multiple employee csv files from the ADLS Gen2 and used Data flow transformations to seperate good and bad data from the each csv file.
Finally i stored the good and bad rows seperatley in the seperate table in the Azure SQL Database.

## Project #4: Incremental File Copy Based on Last_Modified_Date
This project demonstrates how to incrementally copy newly added or modified files from one ADLS Gen2 folder to another using Azure Data Factory. The pipeline intelligently filters files based on their last modified timestamp.

## Trigger Setup
A Scheduled Trigger is configured to automatically execute the pipeline once daily at 13:00 IST.
